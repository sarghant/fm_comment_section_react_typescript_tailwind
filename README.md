## About

Another challenge found on Frontend Mentor. At first I built it with the data provided upon starting the challenge to fill up the page with content, such as usernames, profile pictures, comment text etc.
But I also intended to add interactivity (CRUD) by utilizing the local storage. In the end I managed to do it, but it was unintuitive and even buggy. So I decided to build two versions. One to fully 
replicate the design while using the provided API (which is what the challenge was anyway) and make it fully responsive. And second version, which I will upload next, will not load any existent data, but 
will let you add comments, update them, reply to them and delete them.
